        "The purpose of this notebook is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sale price of houses in King County, Washington. In order to achieve this goal, regression techniques will be implemented to analyze a dataset containing house sale prices between May 2014 and May 2015. Additionally, k-cross fold validation will be utilized to ensure that the model produces reliable and accurate predictions. By developing a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting house sale prices, this project aims to provide valuable insights to home buyers and sellers in the King County area, and also serves as a useful tool for real estate professionals</body></div>"
